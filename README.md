### Hi there 👋

This Git repository is for personal activities unrelated to work.

In addition to my professional responsibilities, I use this space to study, test, and document various topics that pique my curiosity. 

I plan to record both personal explorations and experiences gained through work.

Currently, I am working with technologies such as Next.js, React Native, and Spring Boot. 

The purpose of this repository is to satisfy my personal curiosity and prepare for work-related tasks.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like to know!

안녕하세요! 이 깃은 업무와 관련이 없는 개인적 활동을 위한 깃입니다.  

업무 외에 제가 평소 궁금해 하는 부분을 공부하고 테스트 및 또는 현재까지 경험했던 내용을 차근차근 기록할 예정입니다.

현재는 next.js, react-native 그리고 spring boot등을 공부하고 있습니다.

감사합니다.😄
